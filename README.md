## PC Instructions
While mobile users can use the instructions provided in the text file, PC users may find it cumbersome to copy and paste the code given in the instructions. To streamline the process, I've developed a Chrome extension.

2. Enable developer mode in the top right corner of the page.
3. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the "IC-saver-loader" folder (which you can clone/download from this repository).
4. Visit the Infinite Craft website.
5. Use the extension to enhance your experience. It's simple and easy to use!
6. Profit.
