You can use the mobile txt aswell but its a pain in the ass to copy and paste it all over again....

I've made a chrome extension and the install instructions are as follows:

2.Enable developer mode on the top right corner
3.press load unpacked and select the "IC-saver-loader" folder (which obviosly you need to clone / download it )
4.Go to the infinite craft website
5.And use the extension ( its pretty simple )
